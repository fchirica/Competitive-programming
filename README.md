# competitive-programming

Some of my problems I solved when preparing for competitive programming. Most of them don't have the source of the problem attached, however mostly I worked from romanian online judge infoarena.ro, from polish judge main.edu.pl and from codeforces.com

Here are the problems solved from infoarena.ro: http://www.infoarena.ro/utilizator/florin.elfus?action=stats . Most of them have a folder created here with the corresponding name.
Here are my codeforces.com submissions: http://codeforces.com/submissions/fchirica
Unfortunately, there is no link to see the submissions from main.edu.pl. However, folders containing 3 seemingly random letters are probably from there :)

Some sources were made when I was very young, so my coding style can be awful at times. The code should get more clear as I get older :)
